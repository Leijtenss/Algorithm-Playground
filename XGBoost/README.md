# XGBoost
Repo for testing this algorithm and getting familiar with the mechanics

## Overview of different projects:
* Testing XGBoost on Titanic dataset with a simple classifier and optimizing algorithm parameters
* Kaggle tutorial (https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/xgboost)
* Invalid Yield prediction using the milking robot data from my Milking Robot-repo (https://github.com/Leijtenss/Milking-Robot) as a first step, then applying tuning of hyperparameters to this data
