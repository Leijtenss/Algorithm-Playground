    "One of the most important applications of PCA is for speeding up machine learning algorithms. Using the IRIS dataset would be impractical here as the dataset only has 150 rows and only 4 feature columns. The MNIST database of handwritten digits is more suitable as it has 784 feature columns (784 dimensions), a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples."

You can transform the data onto unit scale (mean = 0 and variance = 1) which is a requirement for the optimal performance of many machine learning algorithms. StandardScaler helps standardize the dataset’s features. Note you fit on the training set and transform on the training and test set. If you want to see the negative effect not scaling your data can have, scikit-learn has a section on the effects of not standardizing your data."
